# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Network Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  improper exception handling within an asynchronous operation, specifically a network request. The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides an improved version with more robust error handling.

The original code lacks specific exception handling, making debugging and user experience less than ideal.  The solution improves upon this by providing more detailed error messages and handling specific exception types for better error reporting and user feedback.
